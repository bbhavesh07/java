//how readObject() and writeObject() internally works
//Ans: Internally ObjectInputStream.readObject()/writeObject() has a reflection which will find whether the
// object(to be serialized) has a method readObject() or writeObject() if exist it will call it other wise
// it will continue in same method. It will use reflection to read the properties of class and then serialize and deserialize.
//each type has predefined length of stream so this way while deserialization it understands how many bytes to be read.

// How multiple objects can be stored and read from one file
//Ans: It is not allowed. One file can store only one serialized object.
// If you really want to store multiple objects use List of objects. So now the list is one object and can be stored.
// Then deserialize the list object and then iterate over list and use all the objects.

//Two benefits why someone will write custom serialization
//1. if there are 100 fields in class and only few fields needs to be added in ser. Instead adding transient to all
//fields, it is better to write writeObject/readObject with only required fields.
//2. If parent class implements Serializable. This is the way we can avoid child class from providing serialization.
// write readObject() and writeObject() in child class and throw NotSerializableException.


//Steps - How serialization works
/*
It writes out the metadata of the class associated with an instance.
It recursively writes out the description of the superclass until it finds java.lang.object.
Once it finishes writing the metadata information, it then starts with the actual data associated with the instance. But this time, it starts from the topmost superclass.
It recursively writes the data associated with the instance, starting from the least superclass to the most-derived class.
