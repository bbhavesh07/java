public class Lenskart {
    //1. [1,2,2,3,4,4,4,7,8] target = 4 returns [4,6] which is starting and ending range of the target.
    //Ans: modified binary search
    //2. given unsorted array find max length of consecutive seq. [5,2,1,0,3,6,7,12,13] return 4 ie. 0,1,2,3
    //Ans: 1. sort and find. 2. hashing - put all elements in set and then for all the starting points of a range, check length
