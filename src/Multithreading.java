        //The other problem is when you create a synchronized instance level method and call it on different objects from different threads.

//How do you make an instance method synchronized for two different objects.
//Ans: For instance methods the lock is associated with object. So if there are two objects the lock is different for
//both of them and they can run in parallel. To avoid this and make it synchronized we declare a static object in the
// class and use it for both the methods. Because the object is static and common to all instances the method is synchronized.
//eg.
